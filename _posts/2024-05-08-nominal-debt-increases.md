# The nominal amount of debt increases over time

Our modern financial system is based on credit money. This money does not gain its value through being backed against a standard, e.g., gold. Rather, certain entities (banks, the government) are allowed to create money out of nothing --- they issue money. The money gains it value either by the government's promise to accept the money for paying taxes or fees or by the banks' threat to sell securities once money is not paid back. 

$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$ --> note that all equations between these tags will not need escaping!
